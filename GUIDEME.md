# How to Play Your Infinite Adventure

Welcome, traveler! This guide will help you navigate the endless possibilities of your unique journey.

## Getting Started

### Starting Your Adventure
When you first launch the application, the AI game master will automatically craft the beginning of your story. You'll be presented with:

1.  A **scene-setting image** on the left.
2.  The first part of your **story** below the image.
3.  A set of **choices** to decide your first action.

### Making Choices
Simply read the story segment and click on the button that corresponds to the action you want to take. Once you make a choice, the engine will craft the next part of your unique story, generate a new image, update the story text, and present you with new choices.

## Mastering Your Journey

### The Dynamic Sidebar
On the right side of the screen, you'll find your adventure status:

-   **Current Quest**: This tells you your main objective. The AI will update this as you complete goals and discover new ones.
-   **Inventory**: This lists all the items you've collected. When the story mentions you've acquired an item, it will automatically appear here.
-   **Achievements**: This section lists all the accolades you have earned. When you unlock a new one, this section will briefly glow and your new achievement will pop into view!

### Engaging in Combat
Sometimes, your path will lead to conflict. When a battle begins:
- The game will enter a **Combat Mode**.
- Your choices will change to specific combat actions like "Attack", "Defend", or "Use Item". Expect vivid descriptions of your actions and their consequences.
- The icon `⚔️` will appear next to your choices to indicate you are in combat.
- Choose your actions wisely to defeat your foes. Once the battle is over, the story and choices will return to normal. Celebrate your victories with a special visual flourish when you win a tough battle! If you are defeated, a somber screen will mark the end of the battle.
- As you become a more seasoned warrior, expect the challenges to grow. You may face tougher foes, groups of enemies, or even epic multi-stage boss battles that will test your strategic thinking.

### Saving Your Progress
Never lose your unique story. You have two ways to save:
-   **Manual Save**: Click the "Save Game" button at any time to open the save menu. You have three slots to save your progress exactly as it is.
-   **Automatic Save**: The game automatically saves your progress every five turns into a dedicated "Autosave" slot. This happens in the background so you can focus on the adventure.
-   **Load Game**: Click "Load Game" to open the menu and return to any of your saved moments.

## The Living World

### Adaptive Difficulty
The world subtly reacts to your skill. If you are succeeding often, challenges may become more difficult. If you stumble, the world may become a bit more forgiving. This happens automatically to keep your adventure engaging.

### Immersive Sounds
Listen for subtle audio cues that enhance the experience: a soft click when you make a choice, a chime when you find an item, and a triumphant shimmer when you unlock an achievement or win a battle.

## A Word of Caution: The Nature of the Infinite
This is not a traditional game. Please keep the following in mind:

-   **Unpredictable AI**: The story, characters, and outcomes are generated by a creative AI. This means the narrative can be wonderfully unpredictable and surprising. It may also occasionally produce unexpected or inconsistent results.
-   **Visual Consistency**: The AI strives to keep character and item appearances consistent in the images it generates, but variations may occur. Think of it as seeing the world through a dream-like lens.
-   **No True "End"**: This adventure is designed to be endless. Your goal is not to "beat the game" but to explore, create a unique narrative, and see where your choices take you.

Enjoy your one-of-a-kind adventure!
